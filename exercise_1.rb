# Write a program that takes a word and returns the pig latin version.
# Here are the (simplified) rules of pig latin:
#
# If the word starts with consonant, move it to the end and then add 'ay'
# Or, if the word starts with a vowel, add 'way' to the end
# e.g. dog  -> ogday
#      up   -> upway
#
# Don't worry about handling multiple consonants
# Assume the words are lowercase.
# Assume your user is a developer — e.g. you don't need to write a user interface.

def pig_latin(word)
  vowels = ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"]
  if !vowels.include?(word.chars.first)
    word[1..-1] + word.chars.first + "ay"
  else
    word + "way"
  end
end

## Tests:

require_relative "./helpers/assert_equal"
assert_equal(pig_latin("dog"), "ogday")
assert_equal(pig_latin("up"), "upway")
